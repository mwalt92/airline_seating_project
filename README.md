# airline_seating_project

The included file is the only file that needs to run to run the project. It requires Tkinter to be installed to run, but that should be it.

Once open there should be 5 options to choose from. In option 1, 2, and 4 is a "Back To Main Menu" button. 
This is how the screen is refreshed to continue choosing new options.

In option 2 I coded a refresh button that destroys the label to be repopulated by clicking a new button.

Option 5 does kill the program as it is supposed to do.

That should be all. Enjoy!
